# Ant Nav

**Ant Nav** is a mobile-first web application designed to collect data from the device's inertial and magnetic sensors, as well as GPS. This project aims to provide a foundation for developing more advanced applications using this data.

## Features
- Access and display mobile device's **inertial, magnetic field**, and **GPS data**.
- Foundation for future applications that utilize sensor and GPS data for navigation or other purposes.
- Mobile-first design for seamless integration with smartphones.

## Technology Stack
- **React**: Frontend framework used to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: Development environment for fast and efficient builds.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Primary programming language.

## Demo
A live demo of the project is deployed at:
[https://labs.antknt47.com/ant-nav](https://labs.antknt47.com/ant-nav)
